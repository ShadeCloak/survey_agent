%\subsection{Enhancing LLM-Generated Code with Software Development Practices}\label{sec:software_practices}

Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in code generation tasks, yet they still face challenges, particularly in terms of code quality, reliability, and integration into broader software development workflows. To address these issues, various frameworks and methodologies propose to leverage LLMs in conjunction with standard software engineering practices. This section provides a comprehensive review of cutting-edge frameworks such as \citet{arxiv.2403.15852}, \citet{arxiv.2403.17134}, and \citet{arxiv.2403.17927}, showcasing their contributions to improving the reliability and acceptability of LLM-generated code within software development environments.

\citet{arxiv.2403.15852} introduce the LCG (LLM-based Code Generation) framework, which simulates established software development processes via multiple LLM agents. By assigning specific roles such as requirement engineer, architect, developer, tester, and scrum master to LLMs, this approach mirrors distinct phases of software development and fosters collaboration. The agents iteratively refine themselves through chain-of-thought and prompt composition techniques, producing higher-quality code. Compared to baseline models like GPT, LCGScrum notably enhances code generation performance across benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, demonstrating an average improvement of +15\%. This underscores the importance of integrating software development practices into LLM training, emphasizing how structured processes can significantly elevate code quality.

Building on this, \citet{arxiv.2403.17134} present the RepairAgent, an autonomous LLM-based framework for program repair. Unlike conventional deep learning methods, RepairAgent enables LLMs to autonomously plan and execute repair actions by leveraging a suite of specialized tools. This flexibility allows the agent to dynamically assess bugs, gather repair ingredients, and validate fixes. Evaluated on the Defects4J dataset, RepairAgent independently repairs 39 bugs unresolved by prior techniques, highlighting the efficacy of integrating autonomous decision-making capabilities into program repair workflows.

To further bridge the gap between LLMs and practical software development, \citet{arxiv.2403.17927} propose the MAGIS, a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework tailored for resolving GitHub issues. Through custom-designed agents such as Manager, Repository Custodian, Developer, and Quality Assurance Engineer, MAGIS orchestrates collaborative efforts in planning and coding. This framework not only substantially improves issue resolution rates but also enhances LLMs' practical applicability in complex software development environments.

The frameworks reviewed collectively illustrate the potential of integrating LLMs with structured software engineering practices. By emulating human-like collaborative development processes, these approaches enable LLMs to generate not only syntactically correct code but also code that aligns with broader software development standards and practices. This integration marks a significant step towards realizing the full potential of LLMs in real-world software development scenarios.

\citet{arxiv.2403.15852}'s LCG framework successfully integrates LLMs into software development processes, enhancing code quality through collaborative refinement. In contrast, \citet{arxiv.2403.17134}'s RepairAgent framework extends the application of LLMs in software engineering by enabling autonomous program repair. The MAGIS framework proposed by \citet{arxiv.2403.17927} further bridges the gap between LLMs and practical software development by customizing multi-agent collaborations for GitHub issue resolution. Each framework contributes uniquely to the integration of LLMs into software development, showcasing the potential of structured practices to enhance LLM-generated code.
