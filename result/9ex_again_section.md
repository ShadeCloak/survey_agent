%In recent advancements in program synthesis, interactive generation through specifications and feedback has garnered significant attention (\citealp{2023InteractivePS}). This method hinges on users providing feedback to guide the synthesis process, thereby mitigating challenges associated with ambiguous or incomplete specifications (\citealp{2023WizardCoder,2023Pangu-Coder2}). Notably, models such as InstructCodeT5+ utilize LLM-generated instructions, alleviating the need for manually curated datasets (\citealp{2023CodeT5+}). In contrast, WizardCoder and Pangu-Coder 2 enhance this process through reinforcement learning, focusing on Test \& Teacher Feedback (RRTF) and compiler feedback, respectively (\citealp{2023WizardCoder}). This synergy of interactive generation and feedback refinement represents a marked evolution in program synthesis methodologies.

The advent of Imitation Learning from Language Feedback (ILF) further revolutionizes code generation by incorporating natural language feedback during training, rather than relying solely on demonstrations (\citealp{2023ILF}). This approach not only reduces the feedback burden on users but also enhances model performance, as indicated by the 38\% increase in pass@1 accuracy on Mostly Basic Python Problems (MBPP) (\citealp{2023ILF}). This finding underscores the efficacy of integrating natural language feedback into the training process.

Reflecting on these advancements, the introduction of text-driven feedback in the form of error messages and stack traces for code generation tasks (LErTi) stands as a pioneering innovation (\citealp{2023Leti}). By iteratively fine-tuning models on concatenated instructions, generated programs, and textual feedback, LErTi achieves state-of-the-art performance on MBPP and generalizes well to other datasets (\citealp{2023Leti}). This method demonstrates the potential of textual feedback in enhancing both generation quality and sample efficiency.

Moreover, the exploration of explora-exploit tradeoffs in refinement strategies has informed the development of more effective iterative refinement algorithms (\citealp{2024Refinement}). This work leverages Thompson Sampling to balance the exploitation of well-performing programs with the exploration of less-tested alternatives, resulting in improved problem-solving capabilities.

In summary, the integration of interactive generation, feedback refinement, and natural language feedback into program synthesis methodologies represents a significant advance in code generation. These innovations not only enhance model performance but also pave the way for more efficient and effective code generation tasks.
