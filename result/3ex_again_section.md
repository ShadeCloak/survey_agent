%In the domain of Large Language Models (LLMs), Executable Code Actions (CodeAct) have emerged as a pivotal technique for enhancing functionality. By incorporating executable Python code, LLM agents are empowered with a unified action space that enables dynamic revision of prior actions based on new observations (\citeauthor{codeact}). This approach has demonstrated remarkable improvements over conventional methods, achieving up to 20\% higher success rates (\citeauthor{codeact}). CodeActAgent, built upon Llama2 and Mistral, is particularly adept at sophisticated tasks such as model training, employing existing libraries, and self-debugging (\citeauthor{codeact}).

In contrast, the Hybrid Question Answering (HQA) approach, exemplified by HProPro, tackles the challenge of reasoning over diverse data sources by leveraging program-based prompting and code execution. This method outperforms baseline systems in few-shot settings, as it does not require specialized retrievers or modal transformations (\citeauthor{hpp}). The effectiveness of executable code actions in enhancing LLM capabilities is thus evident.

The multilingual structured reasoning dataset xSTREET highlights a performance gap between English and non-English reasoning tasks in LLMs. To bridge this gap, augmenting a code dataset with multilingual comments and employing step-by-step code primitives during inference significantly improves performance on xSTREET tasks, without compromising general-purpose abilities (\citeauthor{xstreet}).

The PyBench evaluation framework presents a comprehensive testbed for LLM agents on various real-world coding tasks, demanding complex reasoning and code execution over multiple turns. This benchmark underscores the necessity of robust understanding of Python packages and superior reasoning capabilities (\citeauthor{pybench}). The fine-tuned PyLlama3 model exhibits superior performance, outpacing larger models, underscoring the significance of executable code actions for complex coding tasks.

The CoSm prompting method enhances LLMs' code simulation capabilities, reducing reliance on pattern recognition and memorization (\citeauthor{coSM}). CodeMind evaluates LLM reasoning abilities across multiple tasks and reveals notable performance drops with increased complexity (\citeauthor{codemind}). Lastly, executing natural language algorithms through LLMs has shown promise, particularly for lightweight tasks, highlighting the potential for executable code actions in natural language understanding (\citeauthor{algos-exec}).

In summary, the integration of executable code actions represents a crucial advancement in LLM capabilities, offering enhanced performance and the ability to tackle complex, multilingual reasoning tasks effectively. This methodological approach not only bridges existing performance gaps but also opens new avenues for LLM applications across diverse computational domains.
